    <p>
      The author has a Master's degree in Cultural Studies and previously worked
      as a marketing specialist in a cultural institution. However, an interest
      in website management led her to take a graphics course and secure an
      internship at an advertising agency. She then completed a postgraduate
      course in front-end web application development and successfully developed
      a commercial website using React. This experience helped her secure a
      position at Tom&Co, a Magento e-commerce agency. There she worked for 5
      months as a junior front-end developer, gaining experience in Angular,
      TypeScript, Magento and Git workflow. As a member of the SCRUM team, she
      was responsible for the maintenance and development of e-commerce
      websites. She is currently enrolled in the Frontend course at RS School to
      further develop her skills.
